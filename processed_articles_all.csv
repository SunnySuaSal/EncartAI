Moisture is a major factor in microbial growth on Earth [7, 8, 9], and we hypothesized that it will be a major factor in space [10]. We sought to understand how relative humidity affects spacecraft microbiomes.

Results

We collected dust from the ISS and exposed it to 30% and 85% relative humidity for 2 weeks, and found that fungi grew significantly more at 85% relative humidity (Fig. 1a, b). Fungal concentrations increased 4.6 ± × 101 fold (Fig. 2a, b). Fungal communities shifted from Aspergillus versicolor to Penicillium (Fig. 3a, b) and decreased in alpha (Fig. 4a, b) and beta (Fig. 5a, b) diversity (Fig. 6a, b) (Q < 0.05, R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001). Bacteria did not grow (Fig. 1c, d) but shifted in composition (Fig. 2c, d) at 85% relative humidity (Fig. 5c, d) with R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001.

Conclusion

This study has provided the first analysis of the cardiac effects of combined low-dose rate γ-irradiation and simulated microgravity. The results suggest that the cardiac effects of low-dose rate γ-irradiation and simulated microgravity are not additive.

Methods

Female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 0.01 cGy/h for 21 days, with or without hindlimb unloading (HU) or sham irradiation (control). After 7 days, 1 month, or 4 months, or 9 months. Cardiac tissue was collected for biochemical and histological analysis.

Results

The combination of HU and γ-irradiation demonstrated a significant increase in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione, but not in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts, manganese superoxide dismutase, CD-2, or α-smooth muscle cell actin. Collagen III protein content was not significantly altered by any treatment.

Conclusion

This study has shown that the simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation and HU did not exacerbate the effects of HU on the heart.

Methods

The cost-effectiveness of Health TAPESTRY was evaluated using data from the McMaster FHT site. Costs included the cost to implement Health TAPESTRY and healthcare resources consumed. Health-related quality-of-life was evaluated using the EQ-5L-5L at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Costs were calculated using publicly available sources. QALYs were calculated using the area-under the curve approach. Bootstrapping was used to estimate sampling uncertainty. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. The return on investment (ROI) was calculated. All costs were in 2021 Canadian dollars.

Results

Health TAPESTRY was cost-effective compared to usual care at commonly accepted WTP thresholds ($50,000/QALY gained. The probability that Health TAPESTRY was cost-effective compared to usual care was 0.72 (unadjusted) to 0.96 (SUR) at a WTP of $50,000/QALY gained. The difference-in-differences (DID) and propensity score matching (PSM) methods were used to account for the non-randomized nature of the trial.

Conclusion

Health TAPESTRY was cost-effective at the McMaster FHT site. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the post-hoc nature of the study and limited sample size.

Here, Gutierrez-Barragan et al. Use frame-wise clustering to identify a set of recurrent fMRI coactivation modes (C-modes) in humans, macaques and mice, which are recurrently visited during rest. The authors find that C-modes are conserved across species and their dynamics are compatible with infraslow oscillator dynamics.

Results

The authors present a frame-wise clustering algorithm to identify C-modes in fMRI time-series from humans, macaques and mice. They find that C-modes are recurrently visited during rest, and their dynamics are compatible with infraslow oscillator dynamics. They also find that C-mode occurrence predicts fMRI connectivity gradients in all species.

Discussion

The authors suggest that their findings offer a framework to relate fMRI network dynamics across mammalian species.

In sNF, semantic information about the current mental state is provided to the participant, as a point in a two-dimensional map representing the similarity of the current mental state to a set of pre-measured mental states (e.g. ‘happy’, ‘content’, ‘sad’, ‘angry’). The semantic information is extracted from the current brain state using RSA [1]. This semantic information is a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of the current brain state and a set of emotional mental states [6]. The map is displayed as a point in a two-dimensional map, and the participant learns to move the point to a target area (e.g. ‘happy’).

3. Discussion

We discuss the potential of sNF in the context of mood disorders. The semantic information is expected to be more specific than conventional fMRI NF, as it provides the participant with a goal for self-regulation. The semantic information is expected to improve the specificity of self-regulation, as it provides a goal for self-regulation. In contrast to conventional fMRI NF, the participant learns to move the point towards a specific mental state, instead of merely increasing activity.

4. Conclusion

Semantic fMRI neurofeedback (sNF) provides semantic information about the current mental state to the participant, while conventional fMRI NF provides information about the strength of activity. sNF is expected to improve the specificity of self-regulation training in mood disorders, as it provides a goal for self-regulation",True,True,

Moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) are holometabolous insects that evolved flight independently [11]. They share a common ancestor, yet moths have a unique flight pattern that involves wing beats during olfaction [12]. The wings of moths beat during flight and while walking [13], whereas butterflies do not. This wing-beat during olfaction is a form of flight-induced airflow around the antennae, altering odour plumes, which could influence olfactory processing. We hypothesized that a circuit that evolved in the context of wing-beats could be co-opted to provide the antennal lobe (AL) with a corollary discharge, which is the sensory prediction of motor output.

We investigated the co-option of a motor-to-sensory circuit in the context of the antennal lobe. In Drosophila, the mesothoracic neurons that innervate the thoracic segments (MDHns) project to the antennal lobes (ALs) [14]. In moths, but not butterflies, the MDHns innervate the ALs.
